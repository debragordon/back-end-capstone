# Back End Capstone: TAKING STOCK

A game where the user spends virtual money to buy stocks and can compete against others to see who earns the most profit. Final back-end capstone project at NSS.

### Goal

Create an online stock market game where players can compete to see who can choose the best stocks and earn the most money over time. Users can create an account, and they are then given $1000 to start. Stocks can be researched from within the app, and then purchased to add to the user's portfolio. Profits of all players are tracked, and a scoreboard of the highest ten scores can be accessed through the navigation bar.

### Tools Used

Node, Express, Angular, PostgreSQL, Knex, Bootstrap, JQuery, Sass, Code editor

### Installation

Create a new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/back-end-capstone.git
```

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now make sure that your PostgreSQL database is up and running. Then, once this is done, start your regular Node server with this Terminal command:

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see and use the app!
